# Key Copier App for T-Embed CC1101 on Bruce
A minimalistic Flipper Zero style app for measuring key biting patterns.

## Installation
1. Upload the file to your T-Embed CC1101, either to the SD Card or using TinyFS
2. In Bruce go to "JS Interpreter" -> Load -> Find and load the file

## Instructions
To measure your key: 
1. Place it on top of the screen.
2. Aling your key to the pin numbers #ToDo add visual guides to align the physical key
3. Adjust each pin's depth until you find the match.

## Notes
IDK how long or how how far i'm taking this project. 
The key copier app on the flipper zero is imho a great idea that can be really useful in multiple contexts.

A big thank you to all the Bruce team, M5Launcher and Bruce discord members for all their hard work.
